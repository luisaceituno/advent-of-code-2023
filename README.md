# Running

I recommend opening the workspace in a [dev container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers).

Run any of the scripts from the repository root, for example:
```bash
# Waits for input from stdin
$ python puzzles/day01/part1.py

# Consumes content from a file called ".input" as stdin input
$ python puzzles/day01/part1.py < .input
```

# Notes

I still have no idea what I'm doing when it comes to Python, so any feedback is appreciated :).
